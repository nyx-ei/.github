# Our vision
At NYX-EI we value everything that develops the potential of human beings and enables them to flourish. Because we come from a continent that at the time of our creation is still searching for its way and defining its vision of happiness, we are given the mission to connect the potential of Africa through all its sons and countries, through its cultures and history, through its heritage and its future. We firmly believe in our ability to actively participate in the development of Africa and its positive contribution to the whole of humanity.

# Our goal
We want to help 1.000.000 people evolve from a professional perspective until 2026.
